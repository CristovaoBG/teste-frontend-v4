# Overview

This is a implementation of a challenge proposed by AIKO. In it, you are the frontend developer for a company that collects data from equipment used in a forestry operation. Among this data are the historical positions and states of the equipment. The state of the equipment indicates what the equipment was doing at a particular moment, whether it was Operating, Idle, or Under Maintenance. The state changes according to the equipment's usage in the operation, while the equipment's position is collected via GPS and is sent and stored periodically by the application.

## Some of the features

![Display latest states with mouse hover](https://github.com/CristovaoBG/teste-frontend-v4/docs/tags.mp4)

![Show timeline history of the status](https://github.com/CristovaoBG/teste-frontend-v4/docs/lista.mp4)
